# Sequence-to-Sequence-Learning-with-Neural-Networks.ipynb
The most common sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models are encoder-decoder models, which commonly use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode the source (input) sentence into a single vector. In this notebook, we'll refer to this single vector as a context vector.
